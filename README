the 3 directories are ready to compile deb (src and bin).

pre-requisites:
- apt-get install ubuntu-dev-tools build-essential debhelper gnupg-agent

In particular you can use them to:
- make install to get the proper tools (build)
- use dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot to make the bin deb
- use debuild -S -sa to make the src deb


To build the deb src:
#####################
- copy ossec-hids-X.Y.Z.tar.gz to ossec-hids-*_X.Y.Z.orig.tar.gz
- update ossec-hids-*-X.Y.Z/debian/changelog (with 'dch -i' command): pay attention to lucid vs precise and to email address (nicolas.zin@gmail.com)
- copy the src directory from ossec-hids-X.Y.Z.tgz to src (in the same directory than Makefile)
- copy the etc directory from ossec-hids-X.Y.Z.tgz to etc (in the same directory than Makefile)
- copy the contrib directory from ossec-hids-X.Y.Z.tgz to contrib (in the same directory than Makefile)
- copy the active-response directory from ossec-hids-X.Y.Z.tgz to active-response (in the same directory than Makefile)
- debuild -i -uc -us -b

- make the .deb available
